- **Classification** problems involve prediction on a boolean variable using data available.
- Applying Linear Regression to classification problems is not a great idea, as a few wide data points can skew the hypothesis and yield poor predictions.
- **Logistic Regression** is an algorithm used for classification problems where the output is always between 0 and 1 unlike Linear Regression.  

**Logistic Regression :** $0 \leq h_\theta \leq 1$
