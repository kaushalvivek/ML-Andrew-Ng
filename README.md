# Condensed Notes - Andrew Ng : Machine Learning

I am not a fan of online MOOC and have avoided taking this particular course for long enough now, but a semester course this time around, and the sadly below-par quality of instruction, has forced me to take ML by Dr.Andrew Ng up. This repo is for notes and codes from Dr.Andrew Ng's course on Coursera.
